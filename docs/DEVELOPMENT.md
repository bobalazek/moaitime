# MyZenBuddy - Development

Once you have finished setting up the environment, you can start the development server using `pnpm dev`. This will start the development server for the web app and API. You shall see the URLs in the terminal output, but here they are again:

- Web app URL: <http://localhost:4200>
- API URL: <http://localhost:3636>
