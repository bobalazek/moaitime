# MoaiTime - Development

Once you have finished setting up the environment, you can start the development server using `pnpm dev`. This will start the development server for the web app and API. You shall see the URLs in the terminal output, but here they are again:

- Web App URL: <http://localhost:4200> (you can also run `pnpm serve --filter=web` to start the Web app only)
- API App URL: <http://localhost:3636> (you can also run `pnpm serve --filter=web` to start the API app only)
- Emails App URL: <http://localhost:3535> (you can also run `pnpm serve --filter=emails-core` to start the Emails app only)
