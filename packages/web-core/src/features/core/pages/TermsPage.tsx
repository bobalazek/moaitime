            renewal date will always be the day immediately following the end date of your current
            subscription period. The credit card used for the subscription purchase will be charged
            at the end of the term outlined in your receipt, unless it is updated prior to the
            renewal date. If we are unable to process your renewal, section 4.1 will apply.

            the Personal Account by giving two (2) weeks' notice via email to the email address
            provided by the Customer in connection with the Personal Account. In case the Customer
            uses the Paid Services, MoaiTime will only cancel the Personal Account until the end of
            the current paid up term.
          </li>
          <li>The statutory right of termination for cause shall remain unaffected.</li>
          <li>
            MoaiTime can – without prejudice to the rights of termination – temporarily or
            permanently block the Personal Account if the Terms and Conditions have been breached.
            You will be informed about the blocking and the duration thereof. The Customer may not
            use the Services while the Personal Account is blocked. Customer does not need to pay
            for the Paid Services as long as the Customer is unable to access or use the Personal
            Account due to the enforcement of this section 7.5.
